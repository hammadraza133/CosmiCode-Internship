The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog was not amused.  
Foxes are clever animals, and dogs are loyal companions.  
In the forest, the fox found some food and shared it with another fox.  
Dogs bark loudly at night to guard their homes.  
Both fox and dog are part of many stories and fables.  
The word dog seems to appear quite often in this little story.
